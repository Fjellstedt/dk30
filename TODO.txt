First Week

	- Cleanup Win64 layer Input so that we dont have to touch this section.[X]
	- Look into hot reloading dlls and experiment with building whilst debugging (Extra). [] 
		(This req. us to have two instances of VS running, one for text editing and one for coding)
	- Make a Rendering wrapper where we can alternate between Rendering APIs (for now remove D2D and just use D3D for simplicity)[].
	- Conceptual Camera from App side that maps to a view port in the renderer.
	- Resource loading (platform) to hold references to Models (app side).
